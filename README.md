# last-minute-meals

An app that tackles the issue of food waste and sustainability. It keeps track of the user’s “virtual fridge” based on the items on their receipt, 
and provides reminders for when items are going bad soon. Based on the foods’ packaging, it gives advice on how to recycle it most effectively. 
Additionally, given how many people are new to cooking in Covid since it’s harder to go out to eat, it recommends dishes to users using those 
items in their fridge, and based on their individual preferences.
